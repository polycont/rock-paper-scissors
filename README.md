# rock-paper-scissors
This is my implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project.

The UI and javascript rework took me about 8 hours to add, whereas the core code probably took about 6. It's been a fun and frustrating journey, even to make such a basic little game!

However, I've enjoyed it greatly and I can't wait for the next major project in the TOP curriculum: Etch-a-Sketch.

As far as remaining TODOs, they're commented in the javascript code, but I'd still like to add the following:

1. Since the Duel Arena in OSRS is (or rather was, it got heavily reworked recently) a hive of gambling-addicted streamers, I wish to add
a 'banking' system of sorts. Instead of reaching a round/score limit, players can battle as long as they have the cash to do so, and can 'stake'
however much gold they want to on each fight. If they run out of cash, they either lose, or maybe can go a bit into debt. Not sure yet.
2. I still need to add animations for selecting the different weapons, as well as sound effects pulled from OSRS itself.
3. I need to add a 'sources' menu that shows where I got all the assets I used (though so far all of them are direct from Jagex, save for the font).
4. I would like to add some kind of pre-gameplay animation that explains the combat triangle.
5. I'd like to add portraits for the player and the enemy, maybe with some light customization.

And that's probably going to be it. This will always be a pretty basic project, even with all the above TODOs checked off. I may just move on. Who knows?

Thanks for reading this wall of text. Onward and upward!
